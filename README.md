## MP3 Quick Search

Copyright 2005, David De Grave <david@ledav.net>

This easy-to-use tool will let you manage your mp3 files directly from your
directory structure.  No database or complicated stuff...  Few tools to
install and setup, few changes in search.php header, a webserver and you are
ready to go.

Main features:
- User / Group access
- Advanced / Normal modes
- View / Modify mp3 v1 header tag (and strip the v2 tags)
- Rename / Trash / Play / Search the mp3(s)
- "Mark" the corrupted ones (move them in a separate directory)
- Upload new mp3 and manage them
- Generate a winamp playlist (.m3u)
- Manage multiple playlists that you can use in a shoutcast webradio
- ...

I use this for myself so, it's not very well documented but should not be
too complex to follow and adapt to your needs...

Feel free to submit your fixes or open issues ...

David.
